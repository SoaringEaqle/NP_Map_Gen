NP-CustomMap
This project is designed to allow you to create custom maps for your Neptune's Pride games. Currently it is a limited version of the menu in the game, but with these notable differences:

All home stars will have the standard default values as the game, but they will have warp gates.
Stars that are claimed from the begining will have radial symetry across players
Stars that start unclaimed are placed randomly or can be placed with radial symetry
Stars that start unclaimed can randomly have 5 economy, 2 industry, 1 science, a number of ships between 0-15, or a warp gate, with a 5% chance of any of those occuring.
Resources among random stars will have an average value of 35 resources to start with. Remember to create an issue for any customization options you want to see.

Game modes:

1) Central Star: The game will have one central, high resource star. It is connected by wormholes to the home stars of other players.
2) (WIP) Ring: The game will place stars in a more ring-shaped fasion
